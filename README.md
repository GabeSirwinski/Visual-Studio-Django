# Visual Studio Django

This was my first project using Django in Visual Studio. 

Previously, I had only used PyCharm and was very happy with my experience.

The Django App created is 'MessagingApp', which is an instant messaging site. 

I used JSON Http Response, AJAX, and my Django model to accomplish the Instant Messaging of the site. 

I also got to use Django's built in user authentication for the first time.
